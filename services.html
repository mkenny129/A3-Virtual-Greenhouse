                            <h3>Bonsai Tree</h3>
                            <p>The bonsai plant is believed to bring good luck and harmony; it is said that if you are gifted a bonsai tree rather than buying it yourself, fortune would doubly smile at you.</p>

                        <li>

                            <p>Monstera is native to tropical rainforests from southern Mexico to Panama, so it comes as no surprise that it prefers a warm, humid environment, making them ideal for indoors.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>

                            <p>The Fiddle-leaf fig is also known as the Ficus lyrata because of its violin-like shaped leaves that remind you of a fiddle - these leaves can grow to be quite enormous.</p>

                        <li>
                            <h3>Bamboo Tree</h3>

Bamboo is a crucial element in the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere; a grove of bamboo releases 35% more oxygen than an equivalent amount of trees.</p>

                        <li>

                            <p>The snake plant symbolizes nature, tranquility, and positive energy. It also represents cleanliness because of its ability to counteract the toxic air present indoors, which is what makes it an amazing house plant.</p>

                        <li>
                            <h3>Venus Flytrap</h3>
                            <p>The Venus flytrap is a flowering plant best known for its carnivorous eating habits. When a Venus flytrap captures prey, it secretes digestive juices in a way similar to how a stomach functions - isn't interspecies biology interesting!</p>
